# Hello! 


My name is ZhanZeHong & I am an Engineer with an aptitude & affinity for bench science, lab design & software.

                    
I spend my time being a husband to [@jkmogan](https://www.instagram.com/jkmogan), father, runner, climber, skier, scientist & [writing code](https://github.com/zhanzehong). 


When I actually think to do it, I also enjoy taking [photos](https://zhanzehong.me/photos).

                
I seldom [tweet](https://twitter.com/zhanzehong), but it's the perfect way to get a hold of me.
